# Linear Regression

## When to use:
- Want a baseline model
- The feature variables correlate with target (but not eachother)


## When not to use:
- More features than observations -> consider ridge Regression
- Many correlated features -> consider Ridge regression
- Little to no correlation between the target and many features -> consider RandomForest regression.


## Advantages:
- Interpretable
- No hyperparameters
- Quick

## Disadvantages:
- Thrown off by outliers
- Does not handle missing data
